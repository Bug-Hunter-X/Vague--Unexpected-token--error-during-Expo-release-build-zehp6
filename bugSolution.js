The issue was caused by a version mismatch in a dependency that worked in development but failed during the release build process. I identified it by carefully reviewing the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files and investigating potential incompatibilities between library versions.  The solution was to update the problematic library to its latest compatible version, updating other dependencies as needed. After running `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo install` to ensure all dependencies were properly resolved, the build process completed successfully without any errors.

Here's an example of code which could be impacted (in this case the issue was not with the code itself but it's versioning):

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrative - the problem may not be here but in a dependent library)
import React from 'react';
import {Text, View} from 'react-native';
import ProblematicLibrary from 'problematic-library';

const MyComponent = () => (
    <View>
        <Text>Hello, Expo!</Text>
        <ProblematicLibrary/>
    </View>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative - showing the updated package.json)
// ... other contents of package.json ...
"dependencies": {
    "problematic-library": "^2.0.0" // Updated to a compatible version
}

// ... rest of package.json
```
