While developing an Expo application, I encountered an unusual error during the build process.  The error message was vague, stating something along the lines of 'Unexpected token' or a similar generic error, without specifying the file or line number causing the issue.  This was particularly frustrating because the code appeared syntactically correct and ran fine in development mode.  The problem only surfaced when attempting to build a release version of the app using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`. I tried various troubleshooting steps such as cleaning the cache (`expo prebuild --clean`), reinstalling dependencies, and checking for typos in my code, but to no avail.
