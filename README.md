# Vague 'Unexpected token' Error during Expo Release Build

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered during the Expo build process where a vague 'Unexpected token' error occurs during the release build, even though the code functions correctly in development mode. The error lacks specific file or line information, making debugging challenging.

## Problem Description

The issue arises when attempting to build a release version of an Expo app (either Android or iOS) using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`. The build process terminates abruptly with a generic 'Unexpected token' error message, providing no useful context for pinpointing the source of the problem. The same codebase executes without errors in development mode.

## Solution

The root cause in this case was an incompatibility between a specific library used in the project and the build environment. Although the library worked fine in development, there may be specific dependencies or configurations required for the release build. The solution might involve: updating the library, using a different library, or carefully checking the library documentation for release-specific configuration instructions.

This repository illustrates the problematic code and its corrected version. The solution may require deeper inspection of the project's dependencies and build process.
